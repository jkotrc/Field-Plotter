* Field Plotter
** About
This project has a rocky road of development behind it, starting as a high school project with quickly
hacked together design and messy code. Since then it has developed into a passion project for learning
OpenGL programming and software design principles as a whole.

The program will be a simple graphing calculator with a floating ImGUI-powered interface. It will
have a 2D and 3D view and allow the user to add electrical charges to the scene to visualize
the force field either as field lines or as a vector field.
